# Basic-harmonic-osilator
The spring-mass motion digitally simulated in this project using the Eular method.
##Physics Model Equation:
x= -(k/m)x

##Method:
The differential equation is discretized using Eular's method.

##Parameters:
m= 1
k= 1
dt= 0.01

##Result:
The system exhibits periodic oscillation. Increasing the spring constant increases the frequency.
